planet-discovery-muria=A distant planet with a strong greenhouse effet. Shallow lakes of highly corrosive [fluid=muriatic-solution] emanate gasses that keep the planet warm. The fluid in the lakes can be extracted with a [entity=offshore-pump]. There seems to be life on the surface.
lichen-cultivation=It seems like [item=acidophile-lichen]s feed upon the energy released by [item=chlorine-salts] when the [fluid=chlorine] is removed from the metals. By placing the salts on an [tile=acidophile-lichen] we can reliably obtain metals on the planet. Their colonies do appear to release extremely strong corrosives in the air which will be a risk for the factory.
eschatotaxite-farming=Tall fungal colonies which feed on their own rotting parts. Extremely rich in carbon and sulfur. They seem to consume the corrosive acids released by [entity=metallic-lichen-colony] and [entity=cotunnite-lichen-colony].
lead-processing=Place the [item=cotunnite] extracted from [fluid=muriatic-solution] on [tile=acidophile-lichen] to free [item=lead] contained inside it and to begin processing this corrosion resistant metal.

oxygenated-bacteria-cultivation=By adding oxygen to the bacteria cultivation environment we can increase the yield of the cultures.
holmium-chloride=Better research on chlorine salts allows us to artificially synthesize holmium chloride to extend the holmium processing chain and increase the amount of holmium we produce on Fulgora. Alongside it, obtain the ability to artificially build lichen colonies, able to live on Fulgora's oil ocean and the deeper parts of Muria's own Muriatic lakes.
shotgun-turret=Modified gun turret design capable of shooting heavy hitting shotgun shots.

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
muria-briefing=[planet=muria] is a highly toxic world rich in life. [tile=acidophile-lichen] and [entity=eschatotaxite] fungi cover the planet's dry lands while lakes of [fluid=muriatic-solution] cover the rest of the surface. [entity=chlorine-salt-deposit] and [item=cotunnite] are salts of [fluid=chlorine] which can be found in different ways on the surface. Both can be purified into ores via the [entity=fungicultural-tower] and the lichen. Beware of the corrosive air released by lichen. Eschatotaxites can protect your factory from its damage. 
acid-immunity-list=Harvesting [entity=metallic-lichen-colony] and [entity=cotunnite-lichen-colony] will release corrosive gasses. These gasses cause damage to most of your machines. The pollution overlay on the map reveals which areas will be dangerous for your machines. The corrosive atmosphere can be reduced by planting and harvesting [entity=eschatotaxite].\nMost player-made entities in polluted tiles on [planet=muria] will take constant damage from the corrosive acids, with some exceptions.\nImmune entities=\n- [entity=acidworking-plant] and [entity=smelting-plant] (These two machines will actually increase the corrosive acids, so beware).\n- [entity=biovat] (The biovat will consume some acids from the air.).\n- All power entities (Power poles, generators and accumulators)\n- [entity=burner-inserter], [entity=inserter], [entity=long-handed-inserter], [entity=transport-belt], [entity=fast-transport-belt], [entity=underground-belt] and [entity=fast-underground-belt].
