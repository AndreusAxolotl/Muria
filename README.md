Beyond Gleba lies a green and yellow world. Its dense high atmospheres traps the heat and maintains the planet's boiling temperatures. Below the acidic clouds lies a land scarred by lakes of Muriatic Solution and plains of rock. Along the acidic coasts massive lichen colonies cover the land, as towering shrooms fight their expansion. A biological war... all for you to take the lead in.

# Muria

This mod adds planet Muria, the world of chlorine and lead!

Should be safe to add in an already started save. Unlike my previous mod [Paracelsin](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Paracelsin) no recipes are changed, some techs are though.

In this corrosive world you'll fight your own pollution while you process chlorine and lead for your military needs.

Conquering this toxic world will grant you access to powerful military technology...

## Planet

Muria is located past Gleba, but before Aquilo. While the route to it is guarded by big asteroids, this planet can be reached before Aquilo, only requiring Gleban and Vulcanusian tech. On the planet you'll have to mine chlorine salts and process them by letting lichens free the metals from the chlorine. This process releases a ton of acids in the air, which will corrode your factory to shreds. To fight this threat (that you cause) you'll have to separate the various parts of your factory, alongside growing the towering eschatotaxite fungi, masters of acid neutralization that will protect your factory from the acidic air (that you released). More info on the corrosive air is in-game.

## Resources

Muria includes the following resources:
- Chlorine Salts, mix of iron and copper chlorine salts
- Metallic lichen colony, colonies of acidophile lichens that grew on chlorine salts
- Eschatotaxite fungi, towering fungi and source of carbon and sulfur-based resources
- Muriatic solution, solution of chlorine, hydronium and cotunnite 
- Cotunnite lichen colony, colonies of acidophile lichens that grew on cotunnite, freeing the lead within it

## New Machines

Muria comes with two new buildings for further automation: the Acidworking Plant and the Smelting Plant

These machines are specialized in some chemical processes and metallurgy-smelting togheter respectfully.

# PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU FIND

## Compat:
- None atm.

### Future Plans:
- Adding more rewards
- Maybe reworking the planet's generation.
- Compatibility with other mods.
